# Online Quizzing System

## Project Overview 
This is an online application which allows users to make and take quizzes. Students and professors will be able to log in so that they could save the quizzes they make or to save the results from the quizzes they took. 

## Running the project
In order to view the project at this stage, you must clone this repository, navigate to the directory where the project is located on your machine, and run the following command: ```./run.sh ``` . After running the command, you will be able to access the site through your localhost domain in your web browser (enter ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` in the url bar). 

__NOTE:__ Currently, this project is configured for machines that run on Linux/Mac OS. For Windows, you'll need to change the env variable from "export" to "set"; more details on this will be updated later.
